# Javascript-D3-Sunburst
Draw a sunburst visualization using a large, hierarchical csv database from the federal Annual Survey of Manufactures

## Info
This is my part of a group project where we visualized the industrial manufacturing data from the US's Annual Survey of Manufactures. I had to create my own sunburst visualization since we were working with a .csv file of multidimensional data. Then, missing data points and missing tree data had to be generated. Note: The original project allowed one to select any number of states, yet this does not have 100% of those options.
